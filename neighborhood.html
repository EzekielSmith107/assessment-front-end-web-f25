        Twinleaf Town (Japanese: フタバタウン Futaba Town) is situated in the southwestern part of the Sinnoh region. 
        It is the hometown of the Sinnohan player character and their rival, Barry, and the first town known to the player in the games. 
        It is also the nearest town to Lake Verity, referred to by residents as their local lake. 
        North of the town lies Route 201, a junction which leads to Verity Lakefront to the west, and Sandgem Town to the east.
        In the southern borderline of trees of the town sits a small pond where an Odd Keystone can be found, where the player can surf to reach it.
